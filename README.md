# Clicky Game

## Overview

This is a memory game developed with React. The app's UI is divided into components, component state is managed, and then responded to user events.

### Instructions

1. The application will have different images in the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

2. The application will keep track of the user's score. The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.
